        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life, with a unique combination of liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and a stable climate.
 It is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, bulging slightly at the equator due to its rotation, and its surface is approximately 71% water, with the remaining 29% being land.
 The planet is estimated to be about 4.54 billion years old and has a complex internal structure consisting of four main layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust.

Earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Greek or Roman god, with the name originating from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground".
The largest continent is Asia, spanning about 6,800 miles (11,000 km), while the largest desert is the Antarctic Desert, classified as a cold desert.</p>

                <li>The length of a degree of arc of latitude is approximately 111 km (69 miles), varying, because of the nonuniformity of Earth’s curvature, from 110.567 km (68.706 miles) at the Equator to 111.699 km (69.41 miles) at the poles.</li>
                <li>Latitude is a measurement on a globe or map of location north or south of the Equator. Technically, there are different kinds of latitude, which are geocentric, astronomical, and geographic (or geodetic), but there are only minor differences between them.

</li>
                <li>Longitude is a measurement of location east or west of the prime meridian at Greenwich, London, England, the specially designated imaginary north-south line that passes through both geographic poles and Greenwich. Longitude is measured 180° both east and west of the prime meridian.</li>
